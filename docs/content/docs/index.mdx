# ASL Recognition Project

Welcome to the ASL Recognition project documentation. This guide provides comprehensive information about our American Sign Language recognition system, including setup instructions, model details, and integration guidelines.

## Overview

The ASL Recognition project is an advanced computer vision system that recognizes American Sign Language gestures in real-time. It combines multiple deep learning models to provide accurate and responsive sign language interpretation.

## Key Features

- Real-time ASL gesture recognition
- Multiple model support (CNN, YOLO, Keypoint Detection)
- Mobile integration capabilities
- High-performance server API
- Comprehensive testing suite

## Quick Links
